# Select Siblings

This is a Figma plugin that helps to quickly select elementâ€™s siblings. Currently, it can select all the elements 
below or above the one which is currently selected. The plugin works best inside auto-layout frames, but can be used in 
any other frame with children sorted by their position on a canvas.

This plugin is work in progress. If you have any comments or feature requests, please file an issue.
