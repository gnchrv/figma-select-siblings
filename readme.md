# Select Siblings
> This is a Figma plugin that helps quickly select elements inside auto-layout frames.

## Roadmap
Hereâ€™s a list of commands I plan to support and their current status:

- [x] **Select to the Beginning**. Selects all the elements located before a selected one (i. e., those positioned above or to the left of the element)

- [x] **Select to the End**. Similarly, extends a selection so as it would include the elements located after the selected one (i. e., below or to the right of it)

- [x] **Select the First**. Basically, select the first elements in a list
- [x] **Select the Last**. Does the same, but with the last element.
- [x] **Expand a Selection Backward**. Adds the previous element to a selection.
- [x] **Expand a Selection Forward**. Similarly, adds the next one.
- [x] **Select Between Elements**. Selects the elements between those that have been already selected.
